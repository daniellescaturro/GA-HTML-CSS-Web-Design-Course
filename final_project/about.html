			<p>Hi, I'm Danielle! I worked in the nonprofit sector for a number of years and over the last several months have been in an exploratory phase for the next stages of my career. I live in Park Slope, Brooklyn with my partner and our dog and cat. Then the pandemic hit and upended everything as it did for everyone. While a lot of people left New York City, my partner and I stayed at home in Brooklyn. Over that time I learned a lot of useful tips and tricks to manage through the situation. I wanted to create a place to share them with you. Please get in touch with me if you'd like to connect. Let's trade stories!
